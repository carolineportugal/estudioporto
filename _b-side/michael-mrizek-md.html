description: "<span class=\"italic\">Final Graduation Project in Architecture & Urban Planning School. Awarded top honors.</span>

<p>This project consists of an architectural intervention in a downtown bus terminal in the city of Brasília, a World Heritage Site, that hides within its structure immense empty, unused, dead spaces in the heart of the city. The intervention consists of three underground buildings interconnected through a wide circulation artery. The main access ramp is located in the wide open-air atrium, where open-air movie showings take place. The fluidity of the ramp contrasts with the orthogonal shapes of the buildings. This elevated pathway penetrates all three buildings, creating a democratic atmosphere where people can freely circulate. The first building is a library—and its façade a large movie screen. In-between buildings there are large underground plazas that function as 'breathing spaces’. The walls of these plazas are intended to be used by graffiti artists, so talented local artists get a chance to showcase their work. The second and third buildings are the film school and the cinema complex, respectively. Two vertical towers, the only visible part of the project from the ground, house elevators and stairs.</p>

<p>Graffiti is a transitory art, it does not belong to the artist. Very much like a building, or a city for that matter, doesn't belong to the architect or urban planner who envisioned it.They're also mutable beings.</p>"
