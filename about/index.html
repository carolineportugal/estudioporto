          About

  My name is Caroline Portugal and I’m a Design Technologist: I design & build digital products.
  I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering—acting as interaction designer, coder and visual designer all rolled together—because this is where I think fresh ideas and innovative solutions come from. I’m also interested in everything typography.
  A-side: I’m currently working on redesigning and building the new site for EurasiaNet. Some other past works include redesign and build for: Democracy International, Golden and Golden Dashboard. I was also part of the team designing and building Astro Digital while working for Development Seed.
  Past life: I’m a trained Architect & Urban Planner and in my past life worked for Davis Brody Bond as an Architectural Designer on the project for the National Museum of African American History & Culture—by far the largest, most complex and more meaningful project I’ve worked on in my life.
  Wishes for my jinni: (1) a pool game with Jacques Derrida, (2) an afternoon climb with Lynn Hill, (3) to watch Elis Regina perform.
