              <p>Hi there! My name is Caroline Portugal and I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering—acting as interaction designer, coder and visual designer all rolled together—because this is where I think fresh ideas and innovative solutions come from. I’m also interested in everything typography.</p>
              <p><span class="uppercase">A-side:</span> I’m currently working on redesigning and building the new site for EurasiaNet. Some other past works include redesign and build for: Democracy International, Golden and Golden Dashboard. I was also part of the team designing and building Astro Digital while working for Development Seed.</p>
              <p><span class="uppercase">Past life:</span> I’m a trained Architect & Urban Planner and in my past life worked for Davis Brody Bond as an Architectural Designer on the project for the National Museum of African American History & Culture—by far the largest, most complex and more meaningful project I’ve worked on in my life.</p>
              <p><span class="uppercase">Wishes for my jinni:</span> (1) a pool game with Jacques Derrida, (2) an afternoon climb with Lynn Hill, (3) to watch Elis Regina perform.</p>
