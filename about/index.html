            <p>Hey there! My name is Caroline Portugal and I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering—acting as interaction designer, coder and visual designer all rolled together—because this is where I think fresh ideas and innovative solutions come from. I’m also interested in everything typography, SVGs and web animations.</p>
            <p><span class="uppercase">A-side:</span> I’m currently working on redesigning and building the new site for <a href="#">EurasiaNet</a>. Some other past works include redesign and build for: <a href="#">Democracy International</a>, <a href="#" class="underline">Golden</a> and <a href="#">Golden Dashboard</a>. I was also part of the team designing and building <a href="#">Astro Digital</a> while working for <a href="">Development Seed</a>.</p>
            <p><span class="uppercase">Past life:</span> I’m a trained Architect & Urban Planner and in my past life worked for <a href="">Davis Brody Bond</a> as an Architectural Designer on the project for the <a href="">National Museum of African American History & Culture</a>—by far the largest, most complex and more meaningful project I’ve worked on in my life.</p>
            <p><span class="uppercase">Wishes for my jinni:</span> (1) a pool game with <a href="">Jacques Derrida</a>, (2) an afternoon climb with <a href="">Lynn Hill</a>, (3) to watch <a href="">Elis Regina</a> perform.</p>
