<!-- description: Final Graduation Project in Architecture and Urban Planning School. Awarded top honors. This project consists of an intervention in a bus terminal in the city of Brasília, a World Heritage Site, that hides within its structure immense empty, unused, dead spaces in the heart of the city. The intervention is composed by three underground buildings interconnected through a wide yellow artery of circulation. The main access is done through the ramp located in the wide open-air atrium, where open-air movie showings take place. The design of the ramp contrasts with the orthogonal shapes of the buildings. The goal with this elevated pathway that penetrates all three buildings was to have a democratic atmosphere where people could freely circulate without necessarily needing to access them. The first building is a Cinematography Library—and its façade a large movie screen. In-between buildings there are large underground plazas that function as 'breathing spaces' and are meant to be used for fairs, exhibitions, and social gatherings. The walls of these plazas are intended to be used by graffiti artists, where talented local artists get a chance to showcase their work. Continuing through the yellow elevated pathway one gets to the Film School. The third and final stop in the yellow artery is the building with the movie theaters, the Space of Cinema. The two vertical elements, the only visible part of the project from the ground, house elevators and stairs. [Graffiti is a transitory art, it does not belong to the artist. Very much like a building, and a city for that matter, don't belong to the architect or urban planner who envisioned it.They're also transitory and mutable beings]. -->
