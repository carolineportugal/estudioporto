category: Typography & 3D Modeling
description: "Given its complex dual nature as both art and science, architecture is often marginalized from other art forms. But even where architecture is art, and perhaps because of its undeniable materiality and scale, its interaction with the other arts is scarce and difficult. Music, painting, cinema, dance: these can frequently walk hand-in-hand. But not architecture. With that in mind, the first goal was to create artistic interventions that would interact with architecture and use it as an essential part of the compositions. The straightforward nature of typography, its malleability, low impact, temporary possibilities, variety in aesthetics and, above all, its powerful way of delivering a message were therefore a great tool.

<p>The second goal was to do an uncommitted exercise in argumentation and critical thinking—uncommitted because the studies were not based on confirmed documented data, as that was not the goal. The main focus was to fly free during the (creative) process: reflect upon a certain circulating story regarding the chosen architecture and create a provocative message on it with the use of type. The case studies selected were buildings that could be easily photographed (easily accessed) and had enough information online regarding its physicality so that 3D models could be produced for final images.</p>"

            <p>Some think of graffiti as a mere act of vandalism, represented by “tags”—a stylized handwriting of a person’s name, usually done to property, private or public, without permission. While tags are its original and most popular form, graffiti art has evolved to become much more. It is common to spot colourful, provocative, spray-painted pieces in urban city spaces. Whilst some consider them a nuisance, its unique looks and elements—with intricate compositions and, more frequently than not, provocative content—have contributed for its recognition in the art world as a legitimate art form—an urban art form.</p>

            <p>Tags have very little visual appeal, but more complex pieces are aesthetically captivating. The planning—including finding the right location and assessing it for future composition—, the incorporation of great diversity of artistic elements, and the in-situ composition’s improvisation show the extent of the artistic complexity involved in creating these urban pieces. <i>Wildstyle</i>, the calligraphic style of interlocking letters, for instance, is an artist’s interpretation of the alphabet, and generally relies on the use of primary colors, fading, and foreground/background composition. As Kant puts it, the artist's intent defines a work's validity as art.</p>

            <p>The piece above combines many of the singularities of graffiti: 1) A specific and singular alphabet, hand-written, bold in colors and shape; 2) Use of foreground and background composition; 3) Bold and vivid colors and gradient; 4) Protest message “Art Nation Without Representation” to communicate graffiti’s categorization as a yet marginalized art, not worthy of bigger museums and galleries; 5) Location: the outside, and not the inside, of an art museum. This is also in reference to the illegal and clandestine placing of these works on various façades in the urban environment.</p>

            <p>Mainstream aviation historians, especially in the US, credit the Wright Brothers with the creation of the first successful heavier-than-air flying machine, able to take off under its own power and capable of sustained and controlled flight. The Wright Brothers used a launching rail for their 1903 flights and a launch catapult for their 1904 and 1905 machines—and continued to use skids for their subsequent flights, which necessitated the use of a dolly running on a track for takeoff.</p>

            <p>Outside of the US, however, and especially in Latin America and Europe, the invention of the airplane is credited to Brazilian aviator Santos Dumont. The <i>Fédération Aéronautique Internationale</i>, founded in France in 1905 to verify aviation records, stated among its rules that an aircraft should be able to take off under its own power in order to qualify for a record—the aircraft had wheeled undercarriages. Supporters of Santos Dumont maintain that this means the 14-bis was, technically, the first successful fixed-wing aircraft.</p>

            <p>The Wright Brothers flew earlier with no official witness, except for their own diary entry, and Santos Dumont took off on wheels before the Wrights did, earning a variety of prizes and official records in France. Santos Dumont’s flights in the 14-bis contributed to the development of aviation by publicly demonstrating the feasibility of heavier-than-air flight, which encouraged other pioneers in Europe to begin or quicken the pace of their experiments.</p>

            <p>The piece above is a reflection on the American truth that the Wright Brothers invented the airplane—data officially displayed by the National Air and Space Museum—by showing conflicting information for the inventor’s name, invention’s date and place of occurrence, and air-craft name.</p>

            <p>The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, known simply as the Kennedy Center, is the busiest performing arts facility in the US: it produces and presents, as stated online, “the greatest examples” of theater, dance, ballet, orchestral, chamber, jazz, popular, and folk music, in addition to multi-media performances for all ages. The Center contains three main venues—concert hall, opera house and theater—which host important performances, both national and international. These expensive performances attract a very selective audience. However, there are also five smaller venues in the Center, with vast program offerings, for more popular attractions—and even free ones.</p>
            <p>Despite its effort to expand its reach beyond the stereotypical arts-center member you might imagine (white, wealthy, and over 40), there’s still a lack of audience diversity— especially since significant artistic movements are left out or underrepresented in the Center’s seasonal programs. Hip-hop, rap, street dance, latin music—to name a few—are strongly present in today’s American urban culture, but not in the Center’s calendar.</p>
            <p>The piece above features the chorus of Anaconda by Nicki Minaj (inspired on Baby Got Back by Sir Mix-a-Lot) displayed on the Center’s façade—its imposing and luxurious architecture and interior in contrast with raw, urban slang words. Formally, the words are placed as to interact and add to the already existing visual rhythm of the building’s façade.</p>

            <p>Politically correct thinking is a way of saying “I see you”, it’s a way of ensureing those around are respected and heard, it’s a way of ensuring there’s no “lesser groups”. In promoting an equality in language and representation of diverse groups, one is ideally trying to promote equality in treatment, in rights. Politically correct thinking is one of the hallmarks of liberal, progressive society: the ability to understand and discuss different points of view without resorting to demeaning language and disparagement. It is all the more important in a society, like ours, of vast social-rights disparities.</p>
            <p>Yet, it doesn’t seem harmful to wonder where the movement stands, and where it’s going—because, really, everything in this world has two sides. The politically correct vocabulary is ever-changing and ever-growing. Pandering to every plea for <a href="http://www.academia.edu/6735062/politically_correct_dictionary" target="_blank">politically correct terminology</a> may be close to impossible. Does it still promote its core value (essentially, equality) or is it heading to an extreme by becoming so puristic and rigorous it may actually weaken the cause rather than strengthen it? And although PC language is typically used by liberal groups, whenever language “best-practices” are involved it’s hard not to think of  <i>Newspeak</i>, the fictional language in George Orwell’s <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>—a controlled language created by a totalitarian state as a tool to limit freedom of thought.</p>
            <p>In this piece, typography is projected on the façade of the Smithsonian Institution Building, known as the Smithsonian Castle, which houses administrative offices. The Institution has been involved in several controversies in the past, with its conducts and curation of certain exhibitions being labeled as politically correct (e.g., the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/01/us/smithsonian-substantially-alters-enola-gay-exhibit-after-criticism.html" target="_blank">Enola Gay Exhibit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_as_America_Art_Exhibition" target="_blank">The West as America Exhibition</a>). There’s also a funny urban legend regarding the Museum of Natural History and the enormous pachyderm that greets visitors atop a recreated chunk of his natural habitat. The elephant that stands in the lobby of the museum is an impressive and beautiful example of masculinity—but after much controversy and complaint, according to rumors, the elephant’s genitals were “modified" as to not be offensive to more delicate viewers.</p>
